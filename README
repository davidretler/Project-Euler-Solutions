Solutions to Project Euler problems I did in free time. Began doing this in high school (2012) in Python/MATLAB but decided to start again in C over winter break. I plan to continue doing these in whatever free time I have, because it's fun. To anyone reading this: I don't post the actual answers on purpose. I recommend using this as inspiration and nothing more.

The Python/MATLAB code I wrote a while ago and haven't test recently, YMMV. The C code should work in gcc with -std=c99 and -Wall, and should return no warnings. Most of these solutions are brute force; nevertheless C is so powerful most execute in less than 5 second (some even faster than 0.1 seconds!)
